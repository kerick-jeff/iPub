    | handle chunked POST requests. Therefore the solution is to output progress
    | to a text file and track the job by reading it live.
    |
    | If you would like to let your users know of the progress on active running
    | conversions set this flag to true.

    | temporary files during the encoding progress. Please set a directory where
    | these can be written to, but make sure PHP is able to read and write to it.

    | Make sure that your path has a trailing slash!
